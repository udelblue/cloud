### Steps

* Configure GCP Provider: Sets up the Terraform provider to interact with your GCP project.
* Create Cloud Storage Bucket: Stores Ansible modules for easy access and distribution.
* Create Compute Engine Instance: Runs Ansible and provides a platform for executing Terraform scripts.
* Configure Instance Metadata: Installs Ansible, Terraform, and clones your Ansible modules repository. Also sets up Terraform backend configuration for remote state management.
Usage:
* Replace Placeholders: Replace placeholders like your-gcp-project-id, your-organization, your-workspace, and your-ansible-modules-repo with your actual values.
* Run Terraform: Execute terraform apply to create the resources defined in the script.
* Access Ansible Instance: Use SSH to connect to the ansible_instance and run Ansible commands to manage your infrastructure.
Additional Considerations:
* Security: Consider implementing appropriate security measures, such as firewall rules and access controls.
* Networking: Adjust network configuration based on your specific requirements.
* Terraform State: Manage Terraform state using a remote backend for collaboration and version control.
* Ansible Modules: Develop or use existing Ansible modules to automate your infrastructure tasks.
By following these steps and customizing the script to your needs, you can effectively use Terraform to create a GCP environment for hosting and managing Ansible Terraform modules.
